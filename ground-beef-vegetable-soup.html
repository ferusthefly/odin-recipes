    <ol>
        <li>Crumble ground beef into a stockpot over medium-high heat; cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Stir carrots, celery, and onion into the ground beef; cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.

Pour 1/4 cup water over the mixture if needed to moisten mixture, replenishing as needed while cooking.

        <li>Bring soup to a simmer, place a cover on the pot, and cook, stirring regularly, until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour.
